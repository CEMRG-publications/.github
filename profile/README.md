# Welcome! üëã

Here you can find all the available code to reproduce papers published by members of the Cardiac Electro-Mechanics Research Group, [CEMRG](www.cemrg.com). 
Not every publication has its corresponding code available. Please note that the code in these repositories is not constantly mantained. This is the code that 
was used to process the data, run simulations, reproduce the figures of the papers, or a combination of these. For any issues please contact directly the 
corresponding author of the publication.

## Where is the repository am I looking for? üîé

If it is available, the repository name will have the structure `FirstAuthorLastName_Year_Journal`, where `Journal` might be an abbreviation of the journal name.
